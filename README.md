# Greater-Purpose Project 2
* Group Project 2

## Purpose
Create a Front End/Back End application incorporating skills learned throughout 1st/2nd portion of Coding Bootcamp.

## User Story
As compassionate person
I want an application where I am able to access an application that will allow me to donate items for charity
So that other users can view items and contact the user and set up a time to pickup the donated item

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* When a user accesses the site via http://localhost:3001/ they are taken to the home page where the Home Button and Login link will be displayed
* When a user selects login,  they have the option of creating an account or loggin in using an existing user id.
* When a user types in Username, Email, Password and then selects create,  they will then be able to log in using the newely created user name and password.
* When the user types in user name and password into login form and selects submit,  they will then be directed back to the home page.
* Once Re directed to the home page,  a user is now able to select Donate item, All Items, User items links
* Donate Item page allows a user to add a new item to the overall database and user database
* All items allows the user to view all donated items by all users
* User items allows a user to view all donated items by the current user that is logged in
