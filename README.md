# Greater-Purpose Project 2
* Group Project 2

## Purpose
Create a Front End/Back End application incorporating skills learned throughout 1st/2nd portion of Coding Bootcamp.

## User Story
As compassionate person
I want an application where I am able to access an application that will allow me to donate items for charity
So that other users can view items and contact the user and set up a time to pickup the donated item

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* When User Types in Artist/Band Name then selects Click For Top 10 Songs button,  A list of Top 10 songs for that artist will append to the See List Of Songs Field.  Each of these songs is a clickable link.  
* When a specific song within the list is selected, a link will append to a second field (Select Shazams Song Link To Listen To Song).  This link will take the user to the shazam video/url where user can listen to song. This click event will also append the song to playlist field and save to local storage.  Local Storage is persistant on page reload.
* When Clear Lists button is selected, See List OF Songs and Select Shazam Song content will clear.  Local storage and playlist will remain until clear playlist button is selected. 
* When Clear Playlist button is selected,  all content on page will clear (including local storage), and page will re-load.

## Project Requirements
* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
